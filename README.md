# The Gleam Programming Language

## Introduction

Gleam is a friendly language for building type-safe, scalable systems!

It compiles to Erlang and has straightforward interop with other BEAM languages such as Erlang, Elixir and LFE.

### The Unique Characteristics of Gleam

Gleam is built on the foundation of the Erlang ecosystem.  Gleam code runs on a virtual machine (V.M.) called "Beam".  The Beam V.M. is a unique marvel of industiral-strength technology.  It is the product of countless hours of engineering, and it gives Gleam the rare feature of fault tolerence.  Combine this with extreme concurrency and you have the unique combination of super powers which Gleam inherites as a result of running on the Beam Virtual Machine. 

Two things set Gleam apart from other languages that target the Beam V.M.:

1.  Static Type Checking. 

    Currently, the well established languages in the Erlang ecosystem are dynamically typed, whereas Gleam leverages the strongest advantages of static typing:
        - As is common with compiled languages, the Gleam compiler checks your code and insists you address any errors before the code is run. Such errors caught by the compiler and fixed early, are errors that your user/customer will never need to experience and they are errors you will never be called to fix in the middle of the night. The bottom line here is that Gleam's compiler enables the creation of better quality, more reliable software that requires less maintenance.
        - When your Gleam code base grows into a larger, more complex project, you can continue to make changes fearlessly. The compiler will identify any related, incidental changes that need to be made, anywhere in the entire code base.
        - Gleam provides carefully crafted, super helpful error messages, leaving you with the experience of having an extremely capable and friendly pair programmer.

2.  Gleam Has An Enthusiastic Community!

     Louis Pilford, Gleam's primary creator, has shown a stong desire and ability to fostor the Gleam community. Louis already has more than 120 enthusiastic sponsors through github. Amung those sponsors is Jos√© Valim, the creator of the very successful Beam language, Elixir.


Aside from targeting the Beam V.M., Gleam can also compile to Javascript.

Being easy to learn is one of Gleam's primary goals.  To keep the language simple, Gleam is designed to have only one way of doing things.

Given the language's simplicity, and the fact that it is written in Rust, the Gleam compiler is very fast.
